# Description
This repository contains the fortran scripts allowing to generate the figures of the paper "Control analysis of cooperativity and complementarity in metabolic regulation; the case of NADPH homeostasis" by Pfeuty et al. (2023).

The repository includes six files:
- fig3.f90 and fig3.out are the fortran code and the executable to generate data plotted in Figure3.
- fig4.f90 and fig4.out are the fortran code and the executable to generate data plotted in Figure4.

The compilation requires three fortran libraries : lapack minpack and seulex.
